XState VSCode enhances the XState development experience by providing VSCode users with features like visual editing, autocomplete, typegen and linting.

## Quickstart

1. [Install via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace â†’](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode)
2. Once installed, you can run `XState: Open Visual Editor` from the command palette to open any machine at your cursor's location.
3. If you have code lens enabled (this can be enabled using [`editor.codeLens`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_default-settings) setting), you'll also see 'Open Visual Editor' floating above each `createMachine` call.

## Features

### Visually edit machines

Edit any XState machine with drag-and-drop using the [Stately Visual editor](https://stately.ai/editor).

## Hints and Tips

### Ignoring machines

If you'd like to ignore linting/autocomplete on a machine, add a `// xstate-ignore-next-line` comment on the line above it:

```ts
// xstate-ignore-next-line
createMachine({});
```

### Nesting typegen files

If you're using [typegen](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/typescript.html#typegen), you can nest the files in VSCode.

We try to detect if you want to have your typegen files nested. This is set to `true` by default but can be disabled using the prompt we show in VSCode or by setting `xstate.nestTypegenFiles` to false.

If you choose to enable file nesting using the prompt, we will set the file nesting feature in VSCode to `true` and add a pattern to nest the generated files.

If you choose not to enable it, we will set `xstate.nestTypegenFiles` to false and won't ask again.

### Refactors

Click the lightbulb when hovering an named action, guard or service in a machine to see available refactors.
